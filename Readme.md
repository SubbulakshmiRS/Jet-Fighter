# **JET FIGHTER PLANE GAME**

3D OpenGL game .

## *Story*
The player being the plane has the below mentioned controls and using the available missles and bombs , it can hit the different obstacles from the ground (volcanoes , mountains , etc ) . The gravity is at play and thus if left unchecked the plane can drop to ground . 

## *Controls* 
SPACE BAR : ```Rise plane```

W : ```Increase speed in forward direction```

Q : ```Rotate counterclockwise```
 
E : ```Rotate clockwise ```

A : ```Tilt plane leftwards```

D : ```Tilt plane rightwards```

Mouse_click_LEFT : ```release missile```

Mouse_click_RIGHT : ```drop bombs```

1 :```Plane view```
```
 This is a view from the planeâ€™s position where only a part of the world in front is
visible.
```

2 : ```Top View```
```
This is a top-down view, as if we were looking vertically downwards from a position
```

3 : ```Tower view```
```
Here, the camera is sitting on a tower, to the side of the plane of playing,observing it at an angle.
```

4 : ```Follow-cam view```
```
This is a view of the plane and the region in front of it from a location behind and above it, as if the camera is following the plane.
```

5 : ```Helicopter-cam view```
```
Camera's position and thus the view2 changes with the cursor movements intuitively.
```

## *Elements*
```
The islands are rnadomly generated .Some islands have volcanoes which have a no flying zone above it . The points can be reduced when flying in no-flying zone area . Missles and Bombs can be shot at the parachutes which will increase the points of the player . Everytime a player reaches near checkpoint , the enemy cannon shoots at the plane and if hit , the player's points reduce .Smoke rings are randomly generated and if the plane passes through the ring , the player's points increase . An arrow showing the direction to the next checkpoint is shown . A compass , fuel tank display and altitude dashboard fixed to the screen is shown .```
